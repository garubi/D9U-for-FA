# D9U-for-FA
A unofficial firmware for [Crumar D9U](https://www.crumar.it/?a=page&p=D9U) for controlling the drawbars of the Roland FA worktations (FA-06, FA-07, FA-08) tonewheel engine.

This simple sketch is based on the original sketch by Guido Scognamiglio (included in the original documentatio of Crumar D9U) and other snippets that I found on the web.

I never tested it on a real D9U (I don't own one), but happened that Crumar released the D9U at the same time I was working on a similar DIY project: so I had the SysEx code for the FA ready 
and being a fan of the Crumar and GSI work I put this together in an evening thinking of releasing it in the spirit of Open Source.
...but then... as often happens I never published the script... espacially because I never found time and need to test it.
Fast forward to october 2022: a user on The Keyboard Corner forum asked for the script so I taked the plunge and put it here.

I ask you, if you try the sketch, to report issues and feedback here: I'm pretty sure that with a few iteration we can have it working.
